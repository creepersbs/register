## Acceptance of Terms

By **submitting a Pull Request, Issue, or any request** to register, manage,
or transfer a subdomain under the **`creepers.sbs`** or **`creepers.cloud`**
domains, you **explicitly confirm** that you have read, understood,
and agree to these Terms of Service.

If you do not agree with these Terms, **do not submit a request**.

## Relationship with the MIT License

The source code contained in this repository is licensed under the **MIT License**.

The MIT License applies **only to the source code** and **does not grant any rights**
to use the **creepers.sbs** or **creepers.cloud** services, domains, or infrastructure.

## Service Description

The **creepers.sbs** service is a **free subdomain service** operated by  
**CreeperHUB / Giocoliere** (referred to as **“CH”**).

Subdomains are requested via **GitHub Pull Requests**, reviewed **manually**,
and approved at the sole discretion of CH.

Once approved, the requester receives control over the DNS records
associated with the subdomain, including the ability to use
**custom Name Server (NS) records**, if requested.

---

## Request Process & Templates

Subdomain requests are made via Pull Requests using the official templates:

- **Single TLD request template**  
  https://github.com/creepersbs/register/blob/main/domains/template.json

- **Complete request template (all supported TLDs)**  
  https://github.com/creepersbs/register/blob/main/domains/complete.template.json

Requests not following the templates or containing false or incomplete
information may be rejected.

Issues may be opened for questions or clarification:  
https://github.com/creepersbs/register/issues/new

## User Responsibility

You acknowledge that **you are solely responsible** for:

- DNS configuration and management
- Content hosted on the subdomain
- Any website, service, application, or server reachable through the subdomain
- Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations

CH **assumes no responsibility** for:

- Abuse or illegal activity

- Downtime or service interruption
- Data loss
- Reputational or financial damage

## DNS & Name Server Usage

If you request or configure **custom NS records**:

- You fully manage the DNS zone using your own provider
- CH has **no technical control** over your DNS configuration
- Any misuse, error, or violation remains **entirely your responsibility**

CH reserves the right to revoke a subdomain if DNS usage violates these Terms.

## Restricted and Reserved Names

You agree **not to request or use** the following under the `creepers.sbs` root domain:

1. **Country or continent codes**  
   (e.g. `en.creepers.sbs`, `eu.creepers.sbs`)  
   → Allowed: `anything.en.creepers.sbs`

2. **Shop / store / ecommerce** names that may appear official

3. **`mc` or `play`** as root subdomains  
   → Allowed: `mc.yourserver.creepers.sbs`

   (`about`, `status`, `whois`, `translate`, or similar)

5. **Any domain listed in the reserved domains list**  
   https://github.com/creepersbs/register/tree/main/domains/reserved/list.json

## Verification & Checks

CH reserves the right to **periodically verify** the usage of any registered subdomain.

Verification may include:

## Removal & Takedown

CH may suspend or remove any subdomain if:

- These Terms are violated
- False or misleading information was provided
- The GitHub account or repository used for registration is deleted
- The subdomain is involved in abuse, scams, phishing, malware, or illegal activity
- A **verified third party** submits a takedown request

### Third-Party Identity Verification

For a third-party takedown request to be considered valid, the requesting party
**must prove their identity and standing**.

The requester must be **one of the following**:

- The legitimate copyright holder of the affected product or content
- A legally authorized representative of the copyright holder
- A **notable individual, company, or organization** whose name, brand, or product
  is being abused or impersonated
- A recognized **institution or authority** reporting a verified violation

In addition, the requester must provide **clear and verifiable proof** of the violation,
such as:

- Evidence of copyright ownership or trademark rights
- Documentation or public records proving affiliation or authority
- A clear explanation of how the subdomain violates their rights or policies
- Any additional information reasonably required by CH

Requests that are **unverifiable, anonymous, frivolous, or abusive**
will be **ignored without response**.

CH reserves the right to reject any takedown request that does not meet
these requirements or that cannot be reasonably verified.

## Usage Limits

- Each user may register up to **3 domains total**
  across **`.sbs`** and **`.cloud`**
- Claiming `name.creepers.tld` reserves all supported TLDs

Limits may change at any time.

## Domain Lifecycle & Transfer

Subdomains are reserved indefinitely unless removed or transferred.

### Domain Transfer (User or Organization)

Transfers require:

1. An explicit request by the current owner
2. Contact via:
   - 📧 Email: [`hello@creeperhub.net`](mailto:hello@creeperhub.net)
   - 💬 Official Discord server: https://creepers.sbs/discord
